# Venmo to YNAB

A tool to convert your Venmo statement CSVs to be YNAB compatible. Go to [Venmo to YNAB website](https://venmotoynab.davidacevedo.me/) to convert your Venmo CSVs to a YNAB supported one.

## How it's build

I built this website with [Astro](https://astro.build/) as I wanted to test out how the framework functions. Specifically, I wanted to see how easy it is to use and how JavaScript works with simple webpages like this one.
